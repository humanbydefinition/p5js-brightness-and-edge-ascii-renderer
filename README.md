## Installation
To get started with the p5.js ASCII Renderer, follow these steps to set up a local or remote web server and run the project:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/humanbydefinition/p5js-brightness-and-edge-ascii-renderer.git
    cd p5js-brightness-and-edge-ascii-renderer
    ```
2. **Set Up a Web Server**:
    - For local development, you need a web server to run the project. Refer to the [p5.js Wiki](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) for detailed instructions on setting up a local server.
3. **Open the Project**:
    - Once the server is set up, open [`index.html`](https://github.com/humanbydefinition/p5js-brightness-and-edge-ascii-renderer/blob/main/index.html) in your browser to see the renderer in action.

_Personally, as described in the above wiki article, I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for a smooth development experience._

Besides this awesome font, I am unfortunately not allowed to redistribute any other fonts here. However, here are some other textmode/pixel fonts that have been successfully tested without any issues:

Feel free to test your favorite fonts, but keep in mind that the current implementation for creating a 2D character tile map texture from a [`p5.Font`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Font) object may not work properly with all fonts. For fonts not mentioned here, characters might overlap into other tiles on the texture.

**If you have font suggestions to share, I'd love to hear them! ðŸ˜Š**
